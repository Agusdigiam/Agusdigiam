# Hi I'm Agustin ðŸ‘‹

My name is AgustÃ­n and I'm from Argentina! I love learning new technologies, working remotely and being able to help people develop.
I have more than 2 years of experience in large-scale software design and development (Backend and Front-End). If you ask me, I'm a fan of Backend ;)
I have experience in both writing software from scratch and maintaining large existing projects. In this time I have developed different applications including ecommerce, mobile and desktop web design.

I love challenges and I'm constantly learning!
